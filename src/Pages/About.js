            <p>Preseason notes: The Lakers’ preseason wasn’t as bad as last year (0-6 and outscored by almost 18 points per 100 possessions with Anthony Davis on the floor), but it wasn’t much better. Their first defensive possession of their first game had Davis losing his man and LeBron James standing still when there was a very obvious rotation to be made. They didn’t rank as low on defense (24th, counting only games involving NBA teams) as they did on offense (30th — 93.9 points scored per 100 possessions), though the Laker who took the most preseason shots was somebody named Cole Swider, who was 14-for-54 (26%). Maybe that would have been Davis, but he missed three games with back tightness.

                A positive was Kendrick Nunn playing five games, registering an effective field goal percentage of 59.0%, and looking both shifty and smooth off the dribble. Plus, the Lakers were outscored by only two points in James’ 76 minutes, with most of the plus-minus damage coming against guys who shouldn’t be in the rotation.

                Something to watch in Week 1: Lineups. There’s talk of Davis starting at center and Westbrook coming off the bench. But the rotation seems far from settled and it’s not clear which guard combinations might actually work. Starting Davis and James on the frontline would also leave the Lakers pretty small on the perimeter, with 6-4 Lonnie Walker IV or 6-5 Austin Reaves starting at the three. That might fly against the Blazers on Sunday, but could present challenges against Andrew Wiggins and Kawhi Leonard.

                After they visit the champs on Tuesday, the Lakers will play 11 of their next 14 games in L.A. This will, once again (and no matter the results), be a fascinating team to watch in the early going.
