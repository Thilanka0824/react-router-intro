            <p>It remains rather amazing how much better the Western Conference was for so long. Over the 22 seasons from 1999-00 through 2020-21, the West won 56.5% of its regular-season games against the East. Only once in that 22-season stretch (2008-09) did the East have a better record in interconference games.

                That remarkable stretch came to an end last season, when the East eked out a victory, going 226-224 in interconference games. And now, the Eastern Conference looks even stronger.

                There were 10 East teams that finished with winning records last season. One of them — the Charlotte Hornets — clearly took a step backward this summer. But the other nine remain strong, and two of them — the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers — imported All-Star guards from the West.

                At least one of those nine teams is not going to make the playoffs, and at least two others will need to qualify via the Play-In Tournament. Last season, the two Eastern Conference Play-In winners were a team that most general managers picked to win the championship (the Brooklyn Nets) and a team that reached the conference finals the year before (the Hawks).

                So who knows how it will shake out this season. All we know is that there will be a lot of must-watch games between those (projected) top nine teams in the East. And there are eight games between those nine teams in Week 1, with only the Hawks not facing one of the other eight. The Miami Heat and Toronto Raptors will each have three games within the group, and they’ll face each other in a two-game series that begins on Saturday night in Miami.</p>
